In this exercise, we will practice writing CSS rules and using different selectors to style specific elements.

To complete the exercise, add rules to the included `css/style.css` file that apply the styling notes listed in the included `index.html` file. (That is: open up the HTML file and look at the comments for what style each element should have. Then write a rule that applies that style to that element).
